# phase-1-weather-project
Trying to make a cool weather site B)
Goal:Make a weather site that is quick, fetches the weather(Type of weather, temperature, And time of day).

Using this API https://wttr.in/ to fetch information from.

The idea is to have search bar with a clickable search button(Animated hopefully)=Submit Event

Then for another event listener I have a toggle button for Fahrenheit/Celsius being displayed.
