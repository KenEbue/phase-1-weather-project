Trying to make a cool weather site B)
Goal:Make a weather site that is quick, fetches the weather(Type of weather, temperature, And time of day).
Initially tried to use 7TIMER! as an API but I couldn't figure out a good way to find Longitude and Lattitude.

Found it easier using this API https://wttr.in/ to fetch weather information.

The idea is to have search bar with a clickable search button(Animated hopefully). This would be a submit event listener.

Then for another event listener I have a toggle button for Fahrenheit/Celsius being displayed.

Stretch goals of mine are to add images to each weather types(Normal/Cold/Rainy etc.) after a search.
